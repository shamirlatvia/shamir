Third Jewish Culture festival presents – Band Forshpil with “Variations of the tradition” on March 31, 2011, 19:00, at [club “Artelis”,](http://www.artelis.lv/) Blaumanja 32.&nbsp;Forshpil means prelude. Young Latvian band with original approach to traditional Jewish music is inspired by folk, rock and jazz music to find new sound for Yiddish songs, Chassidic niguns and klezmer melodies. Vivid and deep, tender and melancholic performance is inevitably connected to Jewish tradition.
