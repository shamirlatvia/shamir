For the first time in many years, an authentic traditional Shabbat, the sacred and festive day Jews celebrate every Saturday, took place in Daugavpils.&nbsp;Five young cantors from the Tel Aviv Cantorial Institute, under the skilled tutelage and artful direction of Naftali Hershtik, and guests from Riga performed. Shabbat begins at 19:00 on Friday. All day Saturday, prayers and Torah reading resounded in the synagogue while the young Israeli cantors performed folk melodies at meal and break times.
