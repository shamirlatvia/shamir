**The Institute for the Study of Problems of National Policy and Interethnic Relations (IIRE)** together with the **European Center for Tolerance**  is launching an Internet portal dedicated to the development of a civil nation in modern Europe.



SITE ADDRESS: [www.ru.civic-nation.org](http://www.ru.civic-nation.org/) and [www.nationalpolicy.ru](http://www.nationalpolicy.ru/)



This is the first project that provides the opportunity to obtain the most detailed information about those aspects of domestic policy that influence its formation: about anti-discrimination legislation, as well as about legislation that impedes the fight against discrimination and national radicalism, about law enforcement practice, attitudes towards minorities, about the activities of radical groups, the level of xenophobia and hate crimes in most European countries.



The site is an **electronic reference book** that allows you to find factual information on selected parameters for each of the 19 monitoring countries. The team is working to expand the geography of the project.



On the site you can also find the latest scientific [Publications](http://www.ru.civic-nation.org/publikatsii/) concerning issues of national and religious politics, as well as issues of creating a civil nation in Russia and beyond, in the section “[Documents](http://www.ru.civic-nation.org/dokumenty/)” - get acquainted with the fundamental international documents related to the topic of human rights and the strategy of individual countries in the field of national politics, and also receive information about upcoming and past [conferences](http://www.ru.civic-nation.org/konferentsii/) and round tables on this topic.



The resource is interactive - each user can take part in the formation of its content by sending information on any of its sections to the site through the “Contacts” section. After prompt verification by moderators, this information will be posted on the site. Thus, this Internet resource will be guaranteed objectivity and information content.
