Zenkovsky came to Latvia with lectures, emigrant professors E. Hartier, V. Starkov, R. Vipper, V. Sinaisky taught at the university. V. Klimenko and others. Of the Jewish scientists, the scientific activities of the deputy of the Latvian Seimas Max Lazerson, the philosopher Mark Weintrobe, the lawyer and editor-in-chief of the magazine “Law and Court” - Oscar Gruzenberg, are most carefully examined. Many other names are mentioned: “Russian Spegler” - Grigory Landau, lawyer August Kaminka, journalist Maxim Ganfman... The monograph uses materials, photographs from private and state archives.
