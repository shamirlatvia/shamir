From the very first day of the Riga Ghetto and Holocaust Museum’s foundation, Edgar Kwiatkowski has been with us – as an artist, ally and guardian of memory. His creative contribution has become an integral part of the museum space, giving it profound emotional and spiritual depth.

His works are presented on the grounds of the Riga Ghetto and Holocaust Museum in Latvia with deep respect and gratitude.

One of the central artistic installations is *“The Jewish Alphabet”*&nbsp;— 22 large letters crafted from valuable Latvian wood. These letters, symbolizing the word *“Emet”*&nbsp;— “Truth,” convey the profound meaning of truth and remembrance woven into the destinies of thousands of lives.

The installation *“Shalom, Riga”*&nbsp;is a warm greeting to the city, carrying a message of peace: “Good day, Riga.” This work brings the light of reconciliation, hope and respect for history.

A special place is held by *“The Tree of Hope”*&nbsp;— a moving monument in honor of the Latvian Righteous Among the Nations who saved Jews during the Nazi occupation. On each leaf of the tree, 321 names of these heroes are engraved and covered with gold — as a sign of eternal gratitude and recognition of their courage.

Also on the museum grounds stands the *Menorah*&nbsp;— the ancient symbol of Judaism, created by Edgar Kwiatkowski for the museum’s opening on 21 September 2010. This artifact remains one of the most respected and recognizable symbols of the Riga Ghetto Museum.

The museum expresses its sincere appreciation to Edgar Kwiatkowski for his contribution to preserving historical memory, cultural heritage, and the artistic interpretation of the tragic and heroic chapters of Jewish history in Latvia. His works not only adorn the museum’s grounds but also deeply touch the hearts of all who come here.
