On September 2, 2011 from 12:00 till 16:00 we read names of 16 000 Jewish children of Latvia and Western Europe who were killed in this country in the Holocaust. Each participant was able to come to the scene of the Vermanes park in Riga and read names of children. We will remember each and every one. The recitation takes place in September, as these children could also go to school.
