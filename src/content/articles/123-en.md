Unfortunately, there are few Jews still alive who was living in Latvia before the World War II and are living here now. So, not so much time left to express our respect and gratitude to them.

“Respect the old one” is said in Torah. Exhibition “Looking into the Eyes of the World” is a sign of respect to elderly people, who have contributed to the prosperity of this country, brought up a generation of respectful people and now are the better part of the Jewish community of Latvia.

A few well-known photographers of Latvia have made photos of more than 70 elderly Jews, who were born in Latvia before 1940. These portraits were exhibited in the Blackhead’s house from 03.09.2009 till 27.09.2009
