The Riga Ghetto and Latvian Holocaust Museum has become the first official Local Access Site in Latvia for the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies — one of the world’s largest collections of video testimonies from Holocaust survivors. Created and curated by Yale University (USA), the archive holds over 4,500 interviews in 15 languages from across the globe.

Through this partnership, researchers, students, and the public can now access these powerful personal stories directly at the museum. This marks an important step in advancing the museum’s educational and research mission and strengthening international memory culture.
