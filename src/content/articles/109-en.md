You are kindly welcome to attend the opening of the exhibition of German artist Dagmar Calais in Riga Ghetto museum on may 14, 2015 at 14:00. With the work, produced for the exhibition in Riga, Dagmar Calais abstains from a facile presentation of the paintings on a wall. Instead, numerous portraits, painted on small canvases, are laying on a bed of dried leaves, arranged asymmetrically on the floor.

The German artist Dagmar Calais addresses this unfathomable crime in an exhibition, which she conceptualized for the Riga Ghetto and Latvian Holocaust Museum, entitled “Two Days in Winter“.
