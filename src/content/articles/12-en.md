The book is dedicated to the tragic event of the Second World War - the deportation of 3,000 Jewish prisoners of the Terezin ghetto to Riga in January and August 1942. The publication is based on archival documents and eyewitness accounts of survivors of the Terezin and Riga ghettos, as well as the concentration camps of Salaspils, Kaiserwald, Stutthof, Buchenwald, Dachau and the death marches. Filled with numerous photographs and documents, it provides a comprehensive picture of Jewish life in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia and clearly demonstrates man's opposition to the machine of destruction.



The book is available in English, Russian, Latvian and German.
