React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of React including components, state, and props.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Key Concepts

- **Components**: The building blocks of React applications
- **JSX**: A syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript
- **State**: Data that can change over time
- **Props**: Data passed from parent to child components

## Getting Started

To start a new React project, you can use Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will create a new React application and start the development server.
